## Dynamic parts of the user interface (UI)

**Score** (top left corner)

    This score will be calculated by how many tasks are completed

**Logo** 

    The logo's heart 'fills up' as the user accrues points 

**Task Section** 

    The number of tasks will be dynamic. The content will be dynamic unless generated by random from set of pre-defined tasks.




<!-- Some of the application is entirely dynamic. IE. The user will have done some actions so as a developer we cannot predict what will be shown. -->

<!-- For example the number next to **Things to do** is dynamic because we cannot predict how many items the user will add to their list. -->

<!-- Can you see any more dynamic pieces? Can you predict any problems with the dynamic pieces? -->
